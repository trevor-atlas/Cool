# Cool

A cooldown tracking addon for World of Warcraft, based on CoolLine, which is sadly no longer maintained

Fixed bugs that prevented the addon from loading or creating styled frames
Fixed a bug where only the first spellbook tab worth of spells was cached, which consequently meant you couldn't see cooldowns for anything but that first spellbook tab
